In this project, I will upload some experimental data and code related to our new work, **SamPose**, for localized evaluation. I believe this work significantly relaxes the prior conditions for object pose estimation, making pose estimation less complex. 
**However, we cannot release all the code, as our paper has not yet been accepted. We are uncertain whether it will ultimately be published. Therefore, we have limited the code to a testing level to protect our legitimate rights**. 
And our work will continue to do further research and development.

**You can experiment with localization by running the following code:**
